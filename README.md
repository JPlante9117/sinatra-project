# Pokédex Research Project

Welcome to Professor Sonia's Pokédex Research Database! This research facility studies the habits of Pokémon in the world around us and compiles it to enhance our understanding of them. If you're already one of Professor Sonia's assistants, please log in, otherwise, please sign up to be an assistant to view the information! Our research is confidential until release, so only members of the site can access the data.

This site allows for the creation of accounts, creation and edits of data entries, and the viewing of all created data entries by those logged in to an account.

## Usage

There are several gems required to work this database, so make sure to run ```bundle install``` prior prior to use.

Additionally, the database needs to be initialized. Run `rake db:migrate` to create the database. If you would like to fill the database with a few examples of data, you may also run `rake db:seed`.

In order to run this program, run `shotgun` in your command line and visit the listed localhost page.

## DEMO

Below is a video demonstrating the usage of the application.
